# DevOps Core Fundamental Project: Stratford Library App
## Author - Tasnim Begum
## Project Objective
<p> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

## Project Initation
<p> For this project, I propose on creating a CRUD application for Stratford Library. This application will be used to: 
<p> ○ Keep track of the different books that they have available
<p> ○ Details of readers borrowing books in the library

<p> Implicit CRUD Functionality of this app will include:
<p>	- CREATE
	<p> ○ Add books
	<p> ○ Add user
<p>     - READ
	<p> ○ View books
	<p> ○ View users
<p>     - UPDATE
	<p> ○ Edit details of all items in the database
<p>     - DELETE
        <p> ○ Remove any item from the database

## Planning & Design
### ERD
<p> To begin with, I had made an Entity Relationship Diagram for the database. This was to help me show the relationship that each of the tables would have in the development process. Below is how the ERD looks for my database:

<p> From making the ERD, it is established that a Customers, Books and Book Order table are going to be added into the database to help with the development of the CRUD Application and - that the relationship between the tables will be represented through the Book Order table. Sample data will also be added into the database once created to show the relationship between the tables. 

### Jira Board
<p> I had decided to create my project board with Jira as it had various features that other providers like Trello did not have. I did not really use Jira as an advanced level, I had mainly used to essentially display the work that I had completed the project and - the tasks that were required to be completed.

### Risk Assessment
<p> My risk assessment for the project was allowing me to find all of the risks that could potentially occur when completing the project.
