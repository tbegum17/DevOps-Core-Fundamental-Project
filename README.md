# DevOps Core Fundamental Project: Stratford Library App
# Project Objective
<p> For this project, I had decided on creating a CRUD application for Stratford Library. This application will be used to: 
<p> ○ Keep track of the different books that they have available
<p> ○ Details of readers borrowing books in the library
	
<p> Implicit CRUD Functionality of this app will include:
<p>	- CREATE
	<p> ○ Add books
	<p> ○ Add user
<p>     - READ
	<p> ○ View books
	<p> ○ View users
<p>     - UPDATE
	<p> ○ Edit details of all items in the database
<p>     - DELETE
        <p> ○ Remove any item from the database

# Planning & Design
## ERD
<p> To begin with, I had made an Entity Relationship Diagram for the database. This was to help me show the relationship that each of the tables would have in the development process. Below is how the ERD looks for my database.
