# DevOps Core Fundamental Project: Stratford Library App
## Author - Tasnim Begum
## Project Objective
<p> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

## Project Introduction
<p> For this project, I propose on creating a CRUD application for Stratford Library. This application will be used to: 
<p> ○ Keep track of the different books that they have available
<p> ○ Details of readers borrowing books in the library

### Implicit CRUD Functionality for the app
<p> CREATE
<p> ○ Add books
<p> ○ Add user
<p> READ
<p> ○ View books
<p> ○ View users
<p> UPDATE
<p> ○ Edit details of all items in the database
<p> DELETE
<p> ○ Remove any item from the database

## Planning & Design
### ERD
<p> To begin with, I had made an Entity Relationship Diagram for the database. This was to help me show the relationship that each of the tables would have in the development process. Below is how the ERD looks for my database:

<p> From making the ERD, it is established that a Customers, Books and Book Order table are going to be added into the database to help with the development of the CRUD Application and - that the relationship between the tables will be represented through the Book Order table. Sample data will also be added into the database once created to show the relationship between the tables. 

### Jira Board
<p> I had decided to create my project board with Jira as it had various features that other providers like Trello did not have. I did not really use Jira as an advanced level, I had mainly used to essentially display the work that I had completed the project and - the tasks that were required to be completed.

### Risk Assessment
<p> My risk assessment for the project was allowing me to find all of the risks that could potentially occur when completing the project. The risks outlined along with the control measures suggested was made before the creation of the CRUD Application so that I will be able to have an idea of what to do if anything went wrong throughout the duration of the project.

## Front End
### Homepage
<p> The homepage is the first page that users will be directed to when trying to access the application. This can be navigated through using the '/' url suffix or entering '/Home' along with the localhost address. The homepage essentially shows a brief introduction to the application and what users can do on it.

### Customers Form Page
<p> The Customers Form page allows the staff at Stratford library to enter in details of customers who often borrow books from the library via the form made. Having this information would be vital for the staff at Stratford Library in case they may wish to contact the customer regarding overdue books or events going on at the library.

### Book Form Page
<p> The Book Form Page allows the staff at the Stratford library to add in details regarding the various books that they have avaliable in the library by using the form created on the page. The staff can also use this for when there is a new set of books delivered to the library so that they are aware of the books avaliable as well as - include in the key information about each book such as the author and genre which can come in handy when organising the library bookshelves.

### Book Order Form Page
<p> The Book Order Form page allows the staff at the library to add in information about the books that have been borrowed and which customers have borrowed them. This can help them to keep track of which customers are due to return their books and what books they have borrowed.

## Testing
<p> For this app, testing was required to be completed to check if the app is functioning and meets the overall objective of the project. The tests that were done to determine this was unit testing and the test coverage of the functions tested were 93% which can be seen in the image below.

<p> The image below indicates that all of the testing that was completed for the application have been successful. This means that the app is functioning and there are no faults included.

## Application Development
The application right now is functionable and able to complete most of the functionalities required for the staff to use in the library. If I was to make improvements to the project it would have been to include a functioning Jenkins server. I had attempted to complete this in the application but it was not functionable and there were many errors while it was being ran. Therefore, I had decided to not include this into my final repository.  Also, for the application I would have added in more CSS style code to make it more user friendly eventhough -  the application is working it is defintely not user friendly and that is an important aspect when creating an application.

## Personal Development
As for a personal development, if I was to complete a project like this for next time it would mainly be to practice and improve my coding skills before starting the project. This is because for this project I had always spent a lot of time fixing errors which turned out to be silly mistakes. If I did not have these errors to worry about I could have spent working on the actual project and having everything completed. Furthermore, time management is an key aspect I would improve on to since for the project I did not really allocate myself enough time to complete tasks or - I was spending a long time doing small tasks which could have finished a lot quicker if I had managed my time better.
