# DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project
This is my DevOps Core Fundamental Project for QA Training Academy. For this project, I had decided on creating a CRUD application for Stratford Library. This application will be used to: 
<p> ○ Keep track of the different books that they have available <\p>
<p> ○ Details of readers borrowing books in the library <\p>
